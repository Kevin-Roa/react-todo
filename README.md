## Summary

This project functioned as my introduction to React; it let me grasp the basic concepts needed to make more complex and indepth projects in the future. Coming from Vue.js, I was able to notice many of the differences between the two as well as form parallels. Using my prior knowledge on Vue.js and my newly attained knowledge via this project, I can push myself to create even greater things.
